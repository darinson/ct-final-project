Our Mission is that as North America’s premier independent power generator, we will deliver renewable and reliable power to our customers, opportunities to our associates, sustainable returns to the families who invest in us, and a better world to the next generation. Based in New York, Denver, and Charlotte, Onward Energy is a company where people and power are always on. We are where renewable meets reliable. See www.onwardenergy.com for more information.

THE CHALLENGE

Climate change has spurred a national policy consensus about the need for transition to a low-carbon electrical grid. Onward’s wind, solar and flexible gas resources play a key role in that transition. One of the primary challenges we face is how to help our customers meet their self-imposed and legally mandated low-carbon targets while still maintaining a high level or reliability and resilience for their ratepayers (i.e., we help keep the lights on). As this is an area of rapidly evolving policy change and complex issues, Onward must actively participate in conversations in the legislative, regulatory and public arenas about how to structure an orderly energy transition, and how Onward’s assets can play a key role in that transition.

THE RESPONSIBILITIES
The Manager of Sustainability and Government Affairs is responsible for developing and executing strategies that are intended to support and drive Onward’s business objectives in the context of the national, regional and state-level transition to a low-carbon grid.

Consult and guide internal and external stakeholders, helping them to articulate, develop, and clarify communication objectives and expected outcomes.
Work with internal and external parties to research and analyze information, prepare presentations, plan logistics, and manage overall coordination of messaging, regulatory and stakeholder engagement and branding opportunities.
Develop and maintain relationships with stakeholders including business leaders, public policy makers and their staffs (elected, appointed and career), trade associations, academics and nonprofits, journalists, industry partners, local communities and influencers.
Build and maintain partnerships with businesses, community groups, and educational institutions to promote initiatives; develop and execute strategies to engage with diverse community groups; work collaboratively with internal and external stakeholders.

THE PROFILE TO SUCCEED
Bachelor’s degree in Journalism, Politics or Political Science, Economics, Public Relations or Communications (or similar field reasonably related to the responsibilities of the job).
Minimum of 4 years in a legislative, executive or regulatory office or agency (federal or state), or a non-governmental entity with substantial interaction with the political, regulatory and public policy processes. Political campaign experience a plus but not required. Elected official staff experience a plus but not required.
Must thrive in a fast-paced, demanding environment.
Ability to manage multiple projects, activities and deliverables simultaneously
Extensive experience and good intuition for working with stakeholders, legislators, regulators, media and influencers
Superior oral and written communications skills.
Skilled at building effective partnerships across the organization at all levels.
Exceptional verbal/written communication and presentation skills.
Effective time management and organizational skill; keen multi-tasking capabilities and attention to detail.
Willingness to travel, especially during legislative sessions.

We’re known for an unwavering commitment to premium quality coffee and tea and have built direct supplier relationships with the best private coffee farms and tea estates around the world. We select only the top 1% of Arabica beans and the finest hand plucked, whole leaf tea. All our coffee and tea blends are developed at our state-of-the-art facility in Camarillo, CA – giving us total control, for ultimate precision. Once perfected, our beverages are then prepared locally for maximum freshness. We are constantly seeking out new trending flavors, innovative development methodologies and cultural flavor influences.

We believe we are in business for more than making a profit. We want to make a difference. We have always done it this way. Back in the day, Herb Hyman, our founder, advocated for coffee growers and exporters, paying higher prices to help them grow their business. Today we are making a difference at every step of the way, from the communities we source from, to our Team Members in stores, to building a brighter future through investing in our Caring Cup Program. Our genuine care is evident from seed to cup.

FIGS' foundation is built on product quality, and we have a relentless focus on three key areas: fabric, fit and function. We developed our proprietary, performance-oriented fabric technology to meet the demands of the medical profession. FIGS' Technical Collection fabric is wrinkle resistant, moisture-wicking, lightweight, breathable and offers four-way stretch. Our designs are tailored, sophisticated and innovative, incorporating features such as yoga waistbands, smart storage (pockets, zippers, hidden pockets) and inspirational sayings inside each garment that appeal to modern healthcare professionals.

By offering a branded and customer-centric online shopping experience, we are changing how medical professionals buy their workwear. Through our website, social media, and participation in medical conferences and events, we have built a strong following within the medical community and a meaningful connection with our customers, which allows us to understand their needs and to ensure that FIGS is continuously improving and innovating.

159,BMVP - Opportunities for Families Experiencing Homelessness,Montana,d54e616c8c7b80b0,"BMVP - Opportunities for Families Experiencing Homelessness



Family Promise of Yellowstone Valley’s mission is to help homeless families achieve and sustain independence, through a community response to homelessness. Homelessness is an ongoing issue in the Billings community. An annual Point In Time (PIT) survey show there were over 200 individuals experiencing homelessness in our area on a single night in 2018. In the first month of the 2019 school year, Billings Public Schools reported 178 students were experiencing homelessness. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the need for basic housing has skyrocketed, and demand for services at Family Promise of Yellowstone Valley (FPYV) has increased two-fold. In March of 2020, the congregations that housed FPYV’s homeless families closed their doors to visitors, leaving few options for emergency shelter. The pandemic has brought up a serious concern for homeless families in our area, especially regarding the need for infrastructure that safely houses people while they work to address other challenges related to homelessness. FPYV seeks to prevent homelessness among families with children in the Yellowstone Valley by connecting motivated clients to services and education programs that promote independence and sustainability. By expanding and enhancing housing programs that provide services to families, participants will have the opportunity to access resources that help them gain the skills necessary to become more self-reliant and more financially secure. The intended goal of this project is to develop a sustainable plan that will allow the organization to create and expand transitional housing opportunities and services for families experiencing homelessness. In addition to supportive housing, these families will also have increased access to FPYV’s Day Center, expanded aftercare, and intensive case management services that will help families become more self-sustaining.








Member Duties : Assist with the creation and expansion of housing programs that support families experiencing homelessness in Billings, Montana! The overall goal of this project is to create and expand housing opportunities and services for families experiencing homelessness through Family Promise of Yellowstone Valley. Expanding options for affordable, supportive housing will require community awareness and engagement activities and the development of partnerships that support the organization’s housing initiatives.

Do you wake up eager to solve challenging problems for real impact? Would others consider you “extra” ordinary? Are you ready to grow your career to its full potential? If yes, then join our growing team!
Application Deadline: 5pm MT on May 25th, 2021
Program Overview
RMI is an independent nonprofit founded in 1982 that transforms the global energy system to secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future for all. We engage businesses, communities, institutions, and entrepreneurs to accelerate the adoption of market-based solutions that cost-effectively shift from fossil fuels to efficiency and renewables.
With an independent, objective, and fact-based approach, RMI’s Africa Energy Program works with a diverse set of public and private sector partners to solve sub-Saharan Africa’s toughest energy challenges. Fundamentally, we believe that people need and deserve access to clean, reliable, and affordable power, and that historical approaches to energy systems will not enable sustainable economic development for Africa economies in the 21st century and beyond. We are working to change that, leveraging RMI’s global platform and deeply collaborative partnerships across the range of industry stakeholders. Our team is growing, and we seek highly motivated and experienced professionals to join us in this mission.
Our program strategy and team of 20 people focus on three complementary components: 1) expanding the use of holistic energy planning and clean energy portfolios, 2) enabling distributed energy resource (DER) adoption including minigrids to expand access and save costs for stakeholders, and 3) demand-side interventions to drive efficient use of energy that enables local economic development. We act through a “think-do-scale” approach, including: (think) developing transformative business models and influential thought leadership detailing market opportunities; (do) creating partnerships to develop innovative demonstration projects; and (scale) translating results to formalize utility, investor, and development programs.
Currently, the Africa Energy Program works alongside country partners in Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Malawi, with regional scaling activities that include partners across many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Since its inception in 2015, the program has also supported partners in Rwanda, Uganda, and Sierra Leone.
Position Overview
We are seeking a highly-motivated Associate or Senior Associate to join RMI’s Africa Energy Program and help drive cutting-edge solutions to support Africa’s energy transition. As an ideal candidate, you are a creative problem solver who uses your experience, quantitative, and qualitative analytical abilities to conduct compelling research and derive new insights around pressing energy issues. You are collaborative and humble in engaging with local partners to understand market needs and conditions. You don’t settle for the status quo—you actively dig deeper to understand the underlying root of problems and focus on generating new ideas and solutions to those barriers. You have experience working with renewable energy systems, deploying appropriate technologies while working with communities in emerging economies, or both.
As an RMI Associate or Senior Associate, you will collaborate with team members, partner organizations, clients, and stakeholders to craft innovative and practical solutions across the Program’s focus areas and geographies. You will be a core member of the Program and an independent contributor who is a primary driver of research and analysis, working closely with colleagues on projects under the direction of managers and senior staff. You will develop expertise in the Africa Energy Program’s content areas and will provide subject-matter support to other RMIers across the organization.
Examples of your projects might include analyzing least-cost energy solutions as part of a country’s national energy plan, researching DER cost components and assessing priority pathways for reducing costs, visiting rural communities to survey and analyze agricultural productive use electrification opportunities, or interviewing stakeholders to assess the applicability of an innovative utility business model in a new geography.
Your key job responsibilities as an Associate primarily include:
Structure and independently execute research across a broad range of topics.
Identify new ways to track and manage reliable data that sheds new light on problems and solutions.
Lead quantitative analysis and modeling activities within specific project scopes.

Drive thought leadership.
Structure and guide the work of junior team members.
Lead and manage specific projects with support from senior staff.
Lead and manage stakeholder relationships in relation to specific projects.
Contribute publicly at conferences, share expertise in response to media requests, discuss RMI’s work with donors, and direct research collaborations.
Minimum Qualifications:
A graduate degree in an applicable field such as engineering (mechanical, electrical, civil, energy), business (marketing, finance, international), economics, computer science, mathematics, physical and social sciences, OR undergraduate degree and 2-4 years of cumulative work experience and excellent work references.

Exceptional and concise writing capabilities.
A high degree of professionalism, thoughtfulness, and respect across interpersonal interactions.
Demonstrated initiative and accomplishment in previous work.
Preferred Qualifications:
Experience working in sub-Saharan Africa on energy access, climate, renewables, and demand-side topics.

Deep understanding of the electricity industry, including utility and regulatory models.

Do you wake up eager to solve challenging problems for real impact? Would others consider you “extra” ordinary? Are you ready to grow your career to its full potential? If yes, then join our growing team!
Application Deadline: 5pm MT on May 25th, 2021
Program Overview
RMI is an independent nonprofit founded in 1982 that transforms the global energy system to secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future for all. We engage businesses, communities, institutions, and entrepreneurs to accelerate the adoption of market-based solutions that cost-effectively shift from fossil fuels to efficiency and renewables.
With an independent, objective, and fact-based approach, RMI’s Africa Energy Program works with a diverse set of public and private sector partners to solve sub-Saharan Africa’s toughest energy challenges. Fundamentally, we believe that people need and deserve access to clean, reliable, and affordable power, and that historical approaches to energy systems will not enable sustainable economic development for Africa economies in the 21st century and beyond. We are working to change that, leveraging RMI’s global platform and deeply collaborative partnerships across the range of industry stakeholders. Our team is growing, and we seek highly motivated and experienced professionals to join us in this mission.
Our program strategy and team of 20 people focus on three complementary components: 1) expanding the use of holistic energy planning and clean energy portfolios, 2) enabling distributed energy resource (DER) adoption including minigrids to expand access and save costs for stakeholders, and 3) demand-side interventions to drive efficient use of energy that enables local economic development. We act through a “think-do-scale” approach, including: (think) developing transformative business models and influential thought leadership detailing market opportunities; (do) creating partnerships to develop innovative demonstration projects; and (scale) translating results to formalize utility, investor, and development programs.
Currently, the Africa Energy Program works alongside country partners in Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Malawi, with regional scaling activities that include partners across many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Since its inception in 2015, the program has also supported partners in Rwanda, Uganda, and Sierra Leone.
Position Overview
We are seeking a highly-motivated Associate or Senior Associate to join RMI’s Africa Energy Program and help drive cutting-edge solutions to support Africa’s energy transition. As an ideal candidate, you are a creative problem solver who uses your experience, quantitative, and qualitative analytical abilities to conduct compelling research and derive new insights around pressing energy issues. You are collaborative and humble in engaging with local partners to understand market needs and conditions. You don’t settle for the status quo—you actively dig deeper to understand the underlying root of problems and focus on generating new ideas and solutions to those barriers. You have experience working with renewable energy systems, deploying appropriate technologies while working with communities in emerging economies, or both.
As an RMI Associate or Senior Associate, you will collaborate with team members, partner organizations, clients, and stakeholders to craft innovative and practical solutions across the Program’s focus areas and geographies. You will be a core member of the Program and an independent contributor who is a primary driver of research and analysis, working closely with colleagues on projects under the direction of managers and senior staff. You will develop expertise in the Africa Energy Program’s content areas and will provide subject-matter support to other RMIers across the organization.
Examples of your projects might include analyzing least-cost energy solutions as part of a country’s national energy plan, researching DER cost components and assessing priority pathways for reducing costs, visiting rural communities to survey and analyze agricultural productive use electrification opportunities, or interviewing stakeholders to assess the applicability of an innovative utility business model in a new geography.
Your key job responsibilities as an Associate primarily include:
Structure and independently execute research across a broad range of topics.
Identify new ways to track and manage reliable data that sheds new light on problems and solutions.

Our Products:
We’re known for an unwavering commitment to premium quality coffee and tea, and have built direct supplier relationships with the best private coffee farms and tea estates around the world. We select only the top 1% of Arabica beans and the finest hand plucked, whole leaf tea. All our coffee and tea blends are developed at our state-of-the-art facility in Camarillo, CA – giving us total control, for ultimate precision. Once perfected, our beverages are then prepared locally for maximum freshness. We are constantly seeking out new trending flavors, innovative development methodologies and cultural flavor influences. Over the years we have come up with breakthrough beverages like The Original Ice Blended drink, introduced back in 1989, before frozen coffee was a craze, or the Tea Latte. We are always looking to formulate the next fan favorite, making our menu ever-changing and always improving.

Social Responsibility:
We believe we are in business for more than making a profit. We want to make a difference. We have always done it this way. Back in the day, Herb Hyman, our founder, advocated for coffee growers and exporters, paying higher prices to help them grow their business. Today we are making a difference at every step of the way, from the communities we source from, to our Team Members in stores, to building a brighter future through investing in our Caring Cup Program.

The Adaptation Fund is an innovative financing mechanism set up by the Conference of Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), with the purpose of financing concrete climate change adaptation projects and programmes in developing country Parties. At the request of the COP, the GEF is providing secretariat services to the Adaptation Fund Board (the Board), through a dedicated team. Since becoming fully operational in 2010, the Board has approved 125 projects/programmes in over 100 vulnerable countries, for a total funding of US $830 million. Since 1 January 2019, the Adaptation Fund has formally served the landmark Paris Agreement. Do you want to build a career that is truly worthwhile? Working at the World Bank Group provides a unique opportunity for you to help our clients solve their greatest development challenges.

With 189 member countries and more than 120 offices worldwide, we work with public and private sector partners, investing in groundbreaking projects and using data, research, and technology to develop solutions to the most urgent global challenges.

545,"Program Marketing Manager, U.S. Climate Change","Arlington, VA 22201 (Clarendon-Courthouse area)",ff3ca6c762e5c277,"Position Overview:

This is a full-time remote role based in the U.S. with a flexible working location.
About Rare:
Rare inspires change so people and nature thrive. Over more than three decades, Rare has partnered with local organizations to run more than 400 conservation projects in nearly 60 countries all of which rely on humans changing behaviors. Community-led solutions such as coastal fishery recovery, regenerative agriculture, and now climate mitigation.
Over 72% of Americans believe in global warming, and over 55% believe they should be personally doing something to take action. The problem is, people have been told their individual actions, beyond voting and advocacy, do not matter. And the actions they do focus on like recycling are not among the highest impact behaviors.
If just ten percent of Americans adopted seven behaviors (plant-rich diet, electric vehicles, green energy/rooftop solar, food waste reduction, carbon offsets, flying less and sharing their actions with others), we could significantly close the gap towards the US’s reduction goal under the Paris Climate Agreement.
The emerging US climate campaign called Make It Personal www.rare.org/makeitpersonal is Rare’s strategy to empower Americans to take these high-impact actions now.
Rare has one vacancy for a Program Marketing Manager to be the resident subject matter expert and manager of all projects related to either Renewable Energy or Transportation.
Position Overview:
The Program Marketing Manager will join a highly collaborative, cross-functional team that brings together behavioral psychology + user experience design + marketing communications all working towards a mission to inspire 10% of Americans to adopt the individual behaviors that have the most impact to mitigate climate change. Among those behaviors are Renewable Energy (including rooftop solar and RECs for residential homeowners and renters) and Transportation (flying less/air travel, electric vehicles/EVs and carbon credits/offsets.)
Renewable Energy solutions are not equally available in all parts of the country and may not be equally accessible to all socio-economic groups. Likewise, the Transportation behaviors lean towards higher income audiences who may travel frequently for business/vacation, have the means to purchase new vehicles, and have the means to make financial donations or offset their impacts. As with all of our campaigns, we will seek out ways to ensure that equity and inclusion are considered in each project.
As the Program Marketing Manager for your designated topic, you will be key to the day-to-day project management associated with all relevant direct-to-consumer media campaigns (social, paid, PR, influencer, product integration) and will manage relationships with agencies and contractors as well as topic-specific donors, corporate sponsors and key partners.

Do you wake up eager to solve challenging problems for real impact? Would others consider you “extra” ordinary? Are you ready to grow your career to its full potential? If yes, then join our growing team!
Application Deadline: 5pm MT on May 25th, 2021
Program Overview
RMI is an independent nonprofit founded in 1982 that transforms the global energy system to secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future for all. We engage businesses, communities, institutions, and entrepreneurs to accelerate the adoption of market-based solutions that cost-effectively shift from fossil fuels to efficiency and renewables.
With an independent, objective, and fact-based approach, RMI’s Africa Energy Program works with a diverse set of public and private sector partners to solve sub-Saharan Africa’s toughest energy challenges. Fundamentally, we believe that people need and deserve access to clean, reliable, and affordable power, and that historical approaches to energy systems will not enable sustainable economic development for Africa economies in the 21st century and beyond. We are working to change that, leveraging RMI’s global platform and deeply collaborative partnerships across the range of industry stakeholders. Our team is growing, and we seek highly motivated and experienced professionals to join us in this mission.
Our program strategy and team of 20 people focus on three complementary components: 1) expanding the use of holistic energy planning and clean energy portfolios, 2) enabling distributed energy resource (DER) adoption including minigrids to expand access and save costs for stakeholders, and 3) demand-side interventions to drive efficient use of energy that enables local economic development. We act through a “think-do-scale” approach, including: (think) developing transformative business models and influential thought leadership detailing market opportunities; (do) creating partnerships to develop innovative demonstration projects; and (scale) translating results to formalize utility, investor, and development programs.
Currently, the Africa Energy Program works alongside country partners in Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Malawi, with regional scaling activities that include partners across many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Since its inception in 2015, the program has also supported partners in Rwanda, Uganda, and Sierra Leone.
Position Overview
We are seeking a highly-motivated Associate or Senior Associate to join RMI’s Africa Energy Program and help drive cutting-edge solutions to support Africa’s energy transition. As an ideal candidate, you are a creative problem solver who uses your experience, quantitative, and qualitative analytical abilities to conduct compelling research and derive new insights around pressing energy issues. You are collaborative and humble in engaging with local partners to understand market needs and conditions. You don’t settle for the status quo—you actively dig deeper to understand the underlying root of problems and focus on generating new ideas and solutions to those barriers. You have experience working with renewable energy systems, deploying appropriate technologies while working with communities in emerging economies, or both.
As an RMI Associate or Senior Associate, you will collaborate with team members, partner organizations, clients, and stakeholders to craft innovative and practical solutions across the Program’s focus areas and geographies. You will be a core member of the Program and an independent contributor who is a primary driver of research and analysis, working closely with colleagues on projects under the direction of managers and senior staff. You will develop expertise in the Africa Energy Program’s content areas and will provide subject-matter support to other RMIers across the organization.
Examples of your projects might include analyzing least-cost energy solutions as part of a country’s national energy plan, researching DER cost components and assessing priority pathways for reducing costs, visiting rural communities to survey and analyze agricultural productive use electrification opportunities, or interviewing stakeholders to assess the applicability of an innovative utility business model in a new geography.
Your key job responsibilities as an Associate primarily include:
Structure and independently execute research across a broad range of topics.
Identify new ways to track and manage reliable data that sheds new light on problems and solutions.
Lead quantitative analysis and modeling activities within specific project scopes.

Drive thought leadership.
