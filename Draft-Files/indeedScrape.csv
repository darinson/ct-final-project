It’s us, the original oatmilk company that started in Sweden back 25 or so years ago and has since expanded to the U.S. where we’ve continued growing at a rate such that we need more brilliant minds to come work with us to keep the momentum going and the oatmilk flowing.

Sustainability, health, and transparency are the core values that guide everything we do.
Basically, we exist to make it easy for people to eat better and live healthier lives without recklessly taxing the planet’s resources in the process. If any of this resonates with you, then maybe you’d like work for Oatly, too. Now onto the formal stuff.
We are looking for a Co-packing Analyst to join our team. This role will support the Director of Contract Manufacturing in implementation projects and coordinate activities between Oatly and both existing and future co packers. You will also be responsible to track and ensure external manufacturing partners meet Oatly’s high expectations in social compliance, quality, regulatory, safety, and overall customer service. As well as, translate business needs to co-packer requirements to secure current and long-range supply capabilities of existing and new products.
Here are the things we want to hire you to do:
Implement scorecard process and ensure ongoing compliance with all co-packer performance metrics
Troubleshoot and lead improvement processing regarding production issues as they occur
Develop and maintain data on potential co-packing partners for current and future product commercialization
Ensure that production requirements are executed successfully and that schedule attainment/adherence goals are achieved
Work directly with Procurement/Sourcing in managing vendor contracts and supply to co-packers
Organize QBRs with major co-pack partners
Coordinate activities between Oatly and external manufacturers
Support Oatly’s operational organization in relation to external manufacturers
Continuously develop and improve processes and best practice related to external manufacturing
Work collaboratively across departments, ie. quality, supply chain, procurement and innovation
Here are the things we think you need:
Bachelors Degree
Experience in operations, manufacturing, supply chain, procurement or a related field, preferably within the food industry
Familiarity with fermentation is preferred
Experience with ERP software required, preferably Microsoft Dynamics 365
Familiar with product life cycle management
Experience with suppliers in a manufacturing setting is a plus
You are self-driven and willing to take bold initiatives to secure success in your projects
You are detail and process oriented
You thrive off of building relationships in a fast-paced environment
And here’s another list of qualities we think make a good Oatly team member:
You feel connected to our mission of encouraging health, sustainability, and transparency
You are a self-starter who doesn’t need direct supervision to motivate you for success – we believe strongly in building a culture of individual accountability and ownership and need partners that can embrace that mentality
You are ready to make your mark in a smaller, growing brand leveraging your experience to deliver amazing results and build an outstanding company
You have entrepreneurial spirit in that you’re comfortable with ambiguity and are energized by the process of building something lasting from the ground up
You enjoy sharing your quirkiness and talents with your coworkers
Another bulleted list felt redundant, so we wrote this long sentence with all the ways we sweeten the deal to work with us, like providing flexible vacation for starters, really great benefits with 100% medical coverage, genuinely great coworkers who want to see the company and each other succeed, a start-up vibe with an established company history, and an employee discount to stock your fridge full of the best non-dairy alternative in the world.

If any of this resonates with you, then maybe you’d like work for Oatly, too. Now onto the formal stuff.

We are looking for an Internal Communicator to join our North American team. This role will be a key part of the Oatly communications team. You will contribute to our mission of connecting and engaging our fast-growing organization through brilliant internal initiatives and content that aligns, educates and inspires. In this role, you will work with the Director of Internal Communications, NA to bring our messages to life to a broadly distributed workforce that functions across a combination of remote, office and factory settings. Challenge accepted? Read on.
Here are the things we want to hire you to do:
Keep company intranet updated with news, employee profiles, and tools and resources relevant to the Oatly NA team
Manage internal editorial calendar
Regularly draft and publish internal news articles, newsletters, and other communications for the Oatly NA team
Work with Internal Communications Director to develop and implement regional newsletter strategy
Work with Internal Communications Director to implement internal communications strategy for OATLY’s North American production sites, leveraging channels like TV screens and town halls
Collaborate with other teams and regions (including HR, Creative, Operations, Global Internal Communications and others) to drive awareness and engagement around important company updates and initiatives, celebrate wins, and ensure all employees feel informed, inspired and connected to the OATLY mission and culture
Design, deploy and analyze employee feedback surveys related to internal communications
Regularly utilize and optimize internal communications tools and channels like Slack, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Outlook and more to promote OATLY’s mission and values to employees
Here are the things we think you need:
Bachelor’s Degree in Communications, Journalism, Marketing, Creative Writing, Business or related field
2+ years working in an internal communications role - this is required
Experience creating compelling business communications
Knowledge of enterprise B2B software solutions, digital tools and content creation across various media for internal communication
Fluency in English (and fluency in Spanish is a plus!)
Basic knowledge of graphic design is a plus
You’re a great writer and expert communicator
You have a feel for how to communicate effectively and efficiently
You must have a solid grasp on structuring excellent communication as well as a knack for tone and an ability to capture our unique brand voice
You are flexible and are ok with ever-shifting plans and goals
You are a self-starter who takes initiative to explore and learn
You like collaboration and you get energy from working with a team
You believe in the company mission and our role in advancing those goals - building a company committed to sustainability, superior nutritional health, and trust - this is important to you and you have been dreaming of finding a company that aligns this closely with your personal values
And here’s another list of qualities we think make a good Oatly team member:
You feel connected to our mission of encouraging health, sustainability, and transparency
You are a self-starter who doesn’t need direct supervision to motivate you for success – we believe strongly in building a culture of individual accountability and ownership and need teammates who can embrace this mentality
You are ready to make your mark on a growing brand, leveraging your experience to deliver amazing results and help us build an outstanding company
You have entrepreneurial spirit in that you’re comfortable with ambiguity and are energized by the process of building something lasting and impactful
You enjoy sharing your talents and unique self with your coworkers
Another bulleted list felt redundant, so we wrote this long sentence with all the ways we sweeten the deal to work with us, like providing flexible vacation for starters, really great benefits with 100% medical coverage, genuinely great coworkers who want to see the company and each other succeed, a start-up vibe with an established company history, and an employee discount to stock your fridge full of the best non-dairy alternative in the world.

Oatly is an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability or veteran status."

About Us:

Born and brewed in Southern California since 1963, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf® has become one of the world’s largest independent and privately-owned specialty coffee and tea retailers. In 1963 we opened our very first store in Brentwood, California. Today we have over 1100 stores in 31 countries as well as regional offices in Singapore and Malaysia. We have always had a creative and caring spirit. This energy embodied by our Team Members made us famous and beloved by our guests, first in Southern California and now around the world. We are a brand centered around passion. A passion for our premium products, our people, the guests and everyone we work with around the world. Passion is contagious, and we’ve got a serious case of it.


Our Products:

We’re known for an unwavering commitment to premium quality coffee and tea and have built direct supplier relationships with the best private coffee farms and tea estates around the world. We select only the top 1% of Arabica beans and the finest hand plucked, whole leaf tea. All our coffee and tea blends are developed at our state-of-the-art facility in Camarillo, CA – giving us total control, for ultimate precision. Once perfected, our beverages are then prepared locally for maximum freshness. We are constantly seeking out new trending flavors, innovative development methodologies and cultural flavor influences. Over the years we have come up with breakthrough beverages like The Original Ice Blended drink, introduced back in 1989, before frozen coffee was a craze, or the Tea Latte. We are always looking to formulate the next fan favorite, making our menu ever-changing and always improving.


Social Responsibility:

We believe we are in business for more than making a profit. We want to make a difference. We have always done it this way. Back in the day, Herb Hyman, our founder, advocated for coffee growers and exporters, paying higher prices to help them grow their business. Today we are making a difference at every step of the way, from the communities we source from, to our Team Members in stores, to building a brighter future through investing in our Caring Cup Program. Our genuine care is evident from seed to cup. It’s why our guests feel comfortable to be themselves and why we are serving so much more than a great cup of coffee or tea."

The medical apparel industry is antiquated, highly fragmented and, until FIGS, was driven solely by low-cost providers offering a limited selection of poor quality products sold through third party distributors. FIGS is revolutionizing the medical apparel industry by creating the highest quality medical apparel in the world and by selling directly to medical professionals through our branded ecommerce site.

FIGS' foundation is built on product quality, and we have a relentless focus on three key areas: fabric, fit and function. We developed our proprietary, performance-oriented fabric technology to meet the demands of the medical profession. FIGS' Technical Collection fabric is wrinkle resistant, moisture-wicking, lightweight, breathable and offers four-way stretch. Our designs are tailored, sophisticated and innovative, incorporating features such as yoga waistbands, smart storage (pockets, zippers, hidden pockets) and inspirational sayings inside each garment that appeal to modern healthcare professionals.

By offering a branded and customer-centric online shopping experience, we are changing how medical professionals buy their workwear. Through our website, social media, and participation in medical conferences and events, we have built a strong following within the medical community and a meaningful connection with our customers, which allows us to understand their needs and to ensure that FIGS is continuously improving and innovating.

FIGS' Threads for Threads initiative is central to our mission. FIGS has donated hundreds of thousands of scrubs to healthcare providers in need around the world."

169,BMVP - Opportunities for Families Experiencing Homelessness,AmeriCorps,Montana,d54e616c8c7b80b0,"BMVP - Opportunities for Families Experiencing Homelessness



Family Promise of Yellowstone Valley’s mission is to help homeless families achieve and sustain independence, through a community response to homelessness. Homelessness is an ongoing issue in the Billings community. An annual Point In Time (PIT) survey show there were over 200 individuals experiencing homelessness in our area on a single night in 2018. In the first month of the 2019 school year, Billings Public Schools reported 178 students were experiencing homelessness. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the need for basic housing has skyrocketed, and demand for services at Family Promise of Yellowstone Valley (FPYV) has increased two-fold. In March of 2020, the congregations that housed FPYV’s homeless families closed their doors to visitors, leaving few options for emergency shelter. The pandemic has brought up a serious concern for homeless families in our area, especially regarding the need for infrastructure that safely houses people while they work to address other challenges related to homelessness. FPYV seeks to prevent homelessness among families with children in the Yellowstone Valley by connecting motivated clients to services and education programs that promote independence and sustainability. By expanding and enhancing housing programs that provide services to families, participants will have the opportunity to access resources that help them gain the skills necessary to become more self-reliant and more financially secure. The intended goal of this project is to develop a sustainable plan that will allow the organization to create and expand transitional housing opportunities and services for families experiencing homelessness. In addition to supportive housing, these families will also have increased access to FPYV’s Day Center, expanded aftercare, and intensive case management services that will help families become more self-sustaining.








Member Duties : Assist with the creation and expansion of housing programs that support families experiencing homelessness in Billings, Montana! The overall goal of this project is to create and expand housing opportunities and services for families experiencing homelessness through Family Promise of Yellowstone Valley. Expanding options for affordable, supportive housing will require community awareness and engagement activities and the development of partnerships that support the organization’s housing initiatives. The VISTA will also create an outreach / marketing plan to reach and serve families in need of housing and support as well as diversify funding streams to ensure housing opportunities and services are sustainable and accessible. This project will alleviate poverty by expanding and enhancing housing options for homeless families that include increased access to resources that will ultimately assist families experiencing homelessness in becoming self-sustaining.
