THE CHALLENGE

Climate change has spurred a national policy consensus about the need for transition to a low-carbon electrical grid. Onward’s wind, solar and flexible gas resources play a key role in that transition. One of the primary challenges we face is how to help our customers meet their self-imposed and legally mandated low-carbon targets while still maintaining a high level or reliability and resilience for their ratepayers (i.e., we help keep the lights on). As this is an area of rapidly evolving policy change and complex issues, Onward must actively participate in conversations in the legislative, regulatory and public arenas about how to structure an orderly energy transition, and how Onward’s assets can play a key role in that transition.

THE RESPONSIBILITIES
The Manager of Sustainability and Government Affairs is responsible for developing and executing strategies that are intended to support and drive Onward’s business objectives in the context of the national, regional and state-level transition to a low-carbon grid.

Consult and guide internal and external stakeholders, helping them to articulate, develop, and clarify communication objectives and expected outcomes.
Work with internal and external parties to research and analyze information, prepare presentations, plan logistics, and manage overall coordination of messaging, regulatory and stakeholder engagement and branding opportunities.
Develop and maintain relationships with stakeholders including business leaders, public policy makers and their staffs (elected, appointed and career), trade associations, academics and nonprofits, journalists, industry partners, local communities and influencers.
Build and maintain partnerships with businesses, community groups, and educational institutions to promote initiatives; develop and execute strategies to engage with diverse community groups; work collaboratively with internal and external stakeholders.

THE PROFILE TO SUCCEED
Bachelor’s degree in Journalism, Politics or Political Science, Economics, Public Relations or Communications (or similar field reasonably related to the responsibilities of the job).
Minimum of 4 years in a legislative, executive or regulatory office or agency (federal or state), or a non-governmental entity with substantial interaction with the political, regulatory and public policy processes. Political campaign experience a plus but not required. Elected official staff experience a plus but not required.
Must thrive in a fast-paced, demanding environment.

About Us:

Born and brewed in Southern California since 1963, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf® has become one of the world’s largest independent and privately-owned specialty coffee and tea retailers. In 1963 we opened our very first store in Brentwood, California. Today we have over 1100 stores in 31 countries as well as regional offices in Singapore and Malaysia. We have always had a creative and caring spirit. This energy embodied by our Team Members made us famous and beloved by our guests, first in Southern California and now around the world. We are a brand centered around passion. A passion for our premium products, our people, the guests and everyone we work with around the world. Passion is contagious, and we’ve got a serious case of it.


Our Products:

We’re known for an unwavering commitment to premium quality coffee and tea and have built direct supplier relationships with the best private coffee farms and tea estates around the world. We select only the top 1% of Arabica beans and the finest hand plucked, whole leaf tea. All our coffee and tea blends are developed at our state-of-the-art facility in Camarillo, CA – giving us total control, for ultimate precision. Once perfected, our beverages are then prepared locally for maximum freshness. We are constantly seeking out new trending flavors, innovative development methodologies and cultural flavor influences. Over the years we have come up with breakthrough beverages like The Original Ice Blended drink, introduced back in 1989, before frozen coffee was a craze, or the Tea Latte. We are always looking to formulate the next fan favorite, making our menu ever-changing and always improving.


Social Responsibility:

We believe we are in business for more than making a profit. We want to make a difference. We have always done it this way. Back in the day, Herb Hyman, our founder, advocated for coffee growers and exporters, paying higher prices to help them grow their business. Today we are making a difference at every step of the way, from the communities we source from, to our Team Members in stores, to building a brighter future through investing in our Caring Cup Program. Our genuine care is evident from seed to cup. It’s why our guests feel comfortable to be themselves and why we are serving so much more than a great cup of coffee or tea."

A little bit about us…

The medical apparel industry is antiquated, highly fragmented and, until FIGS, was driven solely by low-cost providers offering a limited selection of poor quality products sold through third party distributors. FIGS is revolutionizing the medical apparel industry by creating the highest quality medical apparel in the world and by selling directly to medical professionals through our branded ecommerce site.

FIGS' foundation is built on product quality, and we have a relentless focus on three key areas: fabric, fit and function. We developed our proprietary, performance-oriented fabric technology to meet the demands of the medical profession. FIGS' Technical Collection fabric is wrinkle resistant, moisture-wicking, lightweight, breathable and offers four-way stretch. Our designs are tailored, sophisticated and innovative, incorporating features such as yoga waistbands, smart storage (pockets, zippers, hidden pockets) and inspirational sayings inside each garment that appeal to modern healthcare professionals.

By offering a branded and customer-centric online shopping experience, we are changing how medical professionals buy their workwear. Through our website, social media, and participation in medical conferences and events, we have built a strong following within the medical community and a meaningful connection with our customers, which allows us to understand their needs and to ensure that FIGS is continuously improving and innovating.

FIGS' Threads for Threads initiative is central to our mission. FIGS has donated hundreds of thousands of scrubs to healthcare providers in need around the world."

Family Promise of Yellowstone Valley’s mission is to help homeless families achieve and sustain independence, through a community response to homelessness. Homelessness is an ongoing issue in the Billings community. An annual Point In Time (PIT) survey show there were over 200 individuals experiencing homelessness in our area on a single night in 2018. In the first month of the 2019 school year, Billings Public Schools reported 178 students were experiencing homelessness. Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the need for basic housing has skyrocketed, and demand for services at Family Promise of Yellowstone Valley (FPYV) has increased two-fold. In March of 2020, the congregations that housed FPYV’s homeless families closed their doors to visitors, leaving few options for emergency shelter. The pandemic has brought up a serious concern for homeless families in our area, especially regarding the need for infrastructure that safely houses people while they work to address other challenges related to homelessness. FPYV seeks to prevent homelessness among families with children in the Yellowstone Valley by connecting motivated clients to services and education programs that promote independence and sustainability. By expanding and enhancing housing programs that provide services to families, participants will have the opportunity to access resources that help them gain the skills necessary to become more self-reliant and more financially secure. The intended goal of this project is to develop a sustainable plan that will allow the organization to create and expand transitional housing opportunities and services for families experiencing homelessness. In addition to supportive housing, these families will also have increased access to FPYV’s Day Center, expanded aftercare, and intensive case management services that will help families become more self-sustaining.








Member Duties : Assist with the creation and expansion of housing programs that support families experiencing homelessness in Billings, Montana! The overall goal of this project is to create and expand housing opportunities and services for families experiencing homelessness through Family Promise of Yellowstone Valley. Expanding options for affordable, supportive housing will require community awareness and engagement activities and the development of partnerships that support the organization’s housing initiatives. The VISTA will also create an outreach / marketing plan to reach and serve families in need of housing and support as well as diversify funding streams to ensure housing opportunities and services are sustainable and accessible. This project will alleviate poverty by expanding and enhancing housing options for homeless families that include increased access to resources that will ultimately assist families experiencing homelessness in becoming self-sustaining.

Do you wake up eager to solve challenging problems for real impact? Would others consider you “extra” ordinary? Are you ready to grow your career to its full potential? If yes, then join our growing team!
Application Deadline: 5pm MT on May 25th, 2021
Program Overview
RMI is an independent nonprofit founded in 1982 that transforms the global energy system to secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future for all. We engage businesses, communities, institutions, and entrepreneurs to accelerate the adoption of market-based solutions that cost-effectively shift from fossil fuels to efficiency and renewables.
With an independent, objective, and fact-based approach, RMI’s Africa Energy Program works with a diverse set of public and private sector partners to solve sub-Saharan Africa’s toughest energy challenges. Fundamentally, we believe that people need and deserve access to clean, reliable, and affordable power, and that historical approaches to energy systems will not enable sustainable economic development for Africa economies in the 21st century and beyond. We are working to change that, leveraging RMI’s global platform and deeply collaborative partnerships across the range of industry stakeholders. Our team is growing, and we seek highly motivated and experienced professionals to join us in this mission.
Our program strategy and team of 20 people focus on three complementary components: 1) expanding the use of holistic energy planning and clean energy portfolios, 2) enabling distributed energy resource (DER) adoption including minigrids to expand access and save costs for stakeholders, and 3) demand-side interventions to drive efficient use of energy that enables local economic development. We act through a “think-do-scale” approach, including: (think) developing transformative business models and influential thought leadership detailing market opportunities; (do) creating partnerships to develop innovative demonstration projects; and (scale) translating results to formalize utility, investor, and development programs.
Currently, the Africa Energy Program works alongside country partners in Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Malawi, with regional scaling activities that include partners across many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Since its inception in 2015, the program has also supported partners in Rwanda, Uganda, and Sierra Leone.
Position Overview
We are seeking a highly-motivated Associate or Senior Associate to join RMI’s Africa Energy Program and help drive cutting-edge solutions to support Africa’s energy transition. As an ideal candidate, you are a creative problem solver who uses your experience, quantitative, and qualitative analytical abilities to conduct compelling research and derive new insights around pressing energy issues. You are collaborative and humble in engaging with local partners to understand market needs and conditions. You don’t settle for the status quo—you actively dig deeper to understand the underlying root of problems and focus on generating new ideas and solutions to those barriers. You have experience working with renewable energy systems, deploying appropriate technologies while working with communities in emerging economies, or both.
As an RMI Associate or Senior Associate, you will collaborate with team members, partner organizations, clients, and stakeholders to craft innovative and practical solutions across the Program’s focus areas and geographies. You will be a core member of the Program and an independent contributor who is a primary driver of research and analysis, working closely with colleagues on projects under the direction of managers and senior staff. You will develop expertise in the Africa Energy Program’s content areas and will provide subject-matter support to other RMIers across the organization.
Examples of your projects might include analyzing least-cost energy solutions as part of a country’s national energy plan, researching DER cost components and assessing priority pathways for reducing costs, visiting rural communities to survey and analyze agricultural productive use electrification opportunities, or interviewing stakeholders to assess the applicability of an innovative utility business model in a new geography.
Your key job responsibilities as an Associate primarily include:
Structure and independently execute research across a broad range of topics.
Identify new ways to track and manage reliable data that sheds new light on problems and solutions.
Lead quantitative analysis and modeling activities within specific project scopes.

Minimum Qualifications:
A graduate degree in an applicable field such as engineering (mechanical, electrical, civil, energy), business (marketing, finance, international), economics, computer science, mathematics, physical and social sciences, OR undergraduate degree and 2-4 years of cumulative work experience and excellent work references.

A high degree of professionalism, thoughtfulness, and respect across interpersonal interactions.
Demonstrated initiative and accomplishment in previous work.
Preferred Qualifications:
Experience working in sub-Saharan Africa on energy access, climate, renewables, and demand-side topics.
