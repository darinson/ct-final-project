Do you wake up eager to solve challenging problems for real impact? Would others consider you “extra” ordinary? Are you ready to grow your career to its full potential? If yes, then join our growing team!
Application Deadline: 5pm MT on May 25th, 2021
Program Overview
RMI is an independent nonprofit founded in 1982 that transforms the global energy system to secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future for all. We engage businesses, communities, institutions, and entrepreneurs to accelerate the adoption of market-based solutions that cost-effectively shift from fossil fuels to efficiency and renewables.
With an independent, objective, and fact-based approach, RMI’s Africa Energy Program works with a diverse set of public and private sector partners to solve sub-Saharan Africa’s toughest energy challenges. Fundamentally, we believe that people need and deserve access to clean, reliable, and affordable power, and that historical approaches to energy systems will not enable sustainable economic development for Africa economies in the 21st century and beyond. We are working to change that, leveraging RMI’s global platform and deeply collaborative partnerships across the range of industry stakeholders. Our team is growing, and we seek highly motivated and experienced professionals to join us in this mission.
Our program strategy and team of 20 people focus on three complementary components: 1) expanding the use of holistic energy planning and clean energy portfolios, 2) enabling distributed energy resource (DER) adoption including minigrids to expand access and save costs for stakeholders, and 3) demand-side interventions to drive efficient use of energy that enables local economic development. We act through a “think-do-scale” approach, including: (think) developing transformative business models and influential thought leadership detailing market opportunities; (do) creating partnerships to develop innovative demonstration projects; and (scale) translating results to formalize utility, investor, and development programs.
Currently, the Africa Energy Program works alongside country partners in Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Malawi, with regional scaling activities that include partners across many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Since its inception in 2015, the program has also supported partners in Rwanda, Uganda, and Sierra Leone.
Position Overview
We are seeking a highly-motivated Associate or Senior Associate to join RMI’s Africa Energy Program and help drive cutting-edge solutions to support Africa’s energy transition. As an ideal candidate, you are a creative problem solver who uses your experience, quantitative, and qualitative analytical abilities to conduct compelling research and derive new insights around pressing energy issues. You are collaborative and humble in engaging with local partners to understand market needs and conditions. You don’t settle for the status quo—you actively dig deeper to understand the underlying root of problems and focus on generating new ideas and solutions to those barriers. You have experience working with renewable energy systems, deploying appropriate technologies while working with communities in emerging economies, or both.
As an RMI Associate or Senior Associate, you will collaborate with team members, partner organizations, clients, and stakeholders to craft innovative and practical solutions across the Program’s focus areas and geographies. You will be a core member of the Program and an independent contributor who is a primary driver of research and analysis, working closely with colleagues on projects under the direction of managers and senior staff. You will develop expertise in the Africa Energy Program’s content areas and will provide subject-matter support to other RMIers across the organization.
Examples of your projects might include analyzing least-cost energy solutions as part of a country’s national energy plan, researching DER cost components and assessing priority pathways for reducing costs, visiting rural communities to survey and analyze agricultural productive use electrification opportunities, or interviewing stakeholders to assess the applicability of an innovative utility business model in a new geography.
Your key job responsibilities as an Associate primarily include:
Structure and independently execute research across a broad range of topics.
Identify new ways to track and manage reliable data that sheds new light on problems and solutions.

About Us:
Born and brewed in Southern California since 1963, The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf® has become one of the world’s largest independent and privately-owned specialty coffee and tea retailers. In 1963 we opened our very first store in Brentwood, California. Today we have over 1100 stores in 31 countries as well as regional offices in Singapore and Malaysia. We have always had a creative and caring spirit. This energy embodied by our Team Members made us famous and beloved by our guests, first in Southern California and now around the world. We are a brand centered around passion. A passion for our premium products, our people, the guests and everyone we work with around the world. Passion is contagious, and we’ve got a serious case of it.

Our Products:
We’re known for an unwavering commitment to premium quality coffee and tea, and have built direct supplier relationships with the best private coffee farms and tea estates around the world. We select only the top 1% of Arabica beans and the finest hand plucked, whole leaf tea. All our coffee and tea blends are developed at our state-of-the-art facility in Camarillo, CA – giving us total control, for ultimate precision. Once perfected, our beverages are then prepared locally for maximum freshness. We are constantly seeking out new trending flavors, innovative development methodologies and cultural flavor influences. Over the years we have come up with breakthrough beverages like The Original Ice Blended drink, introduced back in 1989, before frozen coffee was a craze, or the Tea Latte. We are always looking to formulate the next fan favorite, making our menu ever-changing and always improving.

Social Responsibility:
We believe we are in business for more than making a profit. We want to make a difference. We have always done it this way. Back in the day, Herb Hyman, our founder, advocated for coffee growers and exporters, paying higher prices to help them grow their business. Today we are making a difference at every step of the way, from the communities we source from, to our Team Members in stores, to building a brighter future through investing in our Caring Cup Program. Our genuine care is evident from seed to cup. It’s why our guests feel comfortable to be themselves and why we are serving so much more than a great cup of coffee or tea."

IBRD and IDA are commonly known as the World Bank, which is organized into six client-facing Regional Vice-Presidencies, several corporate functions, and – as of July 1, 2014 – has introduced fourteen Global Practices (GPs) as well as five Cross-Cutting Solution Areas (CCSAs) to bring best-in-class knowledge and solutions to regional and country clients.

210,545,"Program Marketing Manager, U.S. Climate Change",Rare,"Arlington, VA 22201 (Clarendon-Courthouse area)",ff3ca6c762e5c277,545,"Position Overview:

This is a full-time remote role based in the U.S. with a flexible working location.
About Rare:
Rare inspires change so people and nature thrive. Over more than three decades, Rare has partnered with local organizations to run more than 400 conservation projects in nearly 60 countries all of which rely on humans changing behaviors. Community-led solutions such as coastal fishery recovery, regenerative agriculture, and now climate mitigation.
Over 72% of Americans believe in global warming, and over 55% believe they should be personally doing something to take action. The problem is, people have been told their individual actions, beyond voting and advocacy, do not matter. And the actions they do focus on like recycling are not among the highest impact behaviors.
If just ten percent of Americans adopted seven behaviors (plant-rich diet, electric vehicles, green energy/rooftop solar, food waste reduction, carbon offsets, flying less and sharing their actions with others), we could significantly close the gap towards the US’s reduction goal under the Paris Climate Agreement.
The emerging US climate campaign called Make It Personal www.rare.org/makeitpersonal is Rare’s strategy to empower Americans to take these high-impact actions now.
Rare has one vacancy for a Program Marketing Manager to be the resident subject matter expert and manager of all projects related to either Renewable Energy or Transportation.
Position Overview:
The Program Marketing Manager will join a highly collaborative, cross-functional team that brings together behavioral psychology + user experience design + marketing communications all working towards a mission to inspire 10% of Americans to adopt the individual behaviors that have the most impact to mitigate climate change. Among those behaviors are Renewable Energy (including rooftop solar and RECs for residential homeowners and renters) and Transportation (flying less/air travel, electric vehicles/EVs and carbon credits/offsets.)
Renewable Energy solutions are not equally available in all parts of the country and may not be equally accessible to all socio-economic groups. Likewise, the Transportation behaviors lean towards higher income audiences who may travel frequently for business/vacation, have the means to purchase new vehicles, and have the means to make financial donations or offset their impacts. As with all of our campaigns, we will seek out ways to ensure that equity and inclusion are considered in each project.
As the Program Marketing Manager for your designated topic, you will be key to the day-to-day project management associated with all relevant direct-to-consumer media campaigns (social, paid, PR, influencer, product integration) and will manage relationships with agencies and contractors as well as topic-specific donors, corporate sponsors and key partners. Part of your role will be networking with the various regional and local organizations to help knit together a collective of the best solutions so that we can make the process easier for all end users.
Additionally, you will also participate collaboratively with the SVP, VP and team in the further development of key channel strategies – employers, communities and bank/ credit cards. You’ll provide the topic specific content or insights to support these channel programs, but you may also be engaged as bandwidth permits to take an active role in leading or implementing pilots and early “mini” test programs.
You will be responsible for actively managing knowledge, insights and relationships associated with your topic. You will be the day-to-day owner and fact-checker for any content, materials, and social media messages.
Key Responsibilities:
The Program Marketing Manager will exercise both independent judgement and a collaborative approach to carry out the following responsibilities for their respective topic area:
Actively engage in learning and managing Rare’s cumulative knowledge and insights associated with your topic area
Maintain a working knowledge of Rare and third-party research, stay abreast of current events and trends associated with related industry,
Collaborate with and play a role in shaping the research and learning agenda to fill in knowledge gaps
Synthesize new insights and trend data for routine communication to Rare executive team and board, donors and marketing/PR firms
Seek ways to apply new knowledge to constantly improve communications and resource materials

Do you wake up eager to solve challenging problems for real impact? Would others consider you “extra” ordinary? Are you ready to grow your career to its full potential? If yes, then join our growing team!
Application Deadline: 5pm MT on May 25th, 2021
Program Overview
RMI is an independent nonprofit founded in 1982 that transforms the global energy system to secure a clean, prosperous, zero-carbon future for all. We engage businesses, communities, institutions, and entrepreneurs to accelerate the adoption of market-based solutions that cost-effectively shift from fossil fuels to efficiency and renewables.
With an independent, objective, and fact-based approach, RMI’s Africa Energy Program works with a diverse set of public and private sector partners to solve sub-Saharan Africa’s toughest energy challenges. Fundamentally, we believe that people need and deserve access to clean, reliable, and affordable power, and that historical approaches to energy systems will not enable sustainable economic development for Africa economies in the 21st century and beyond. We are working to change that, leveraging RMI’s global platform and deeply collaborative partnerships across the range of industry stakeholders. Our team is growing, and we seek highly motivated and experienced professionals to join us in this mission.
Our program strategy and team of 20 people focus on three complementary components: 1) expanding the use of holistic energy planning and clean energy portfolios, 2) enabling distributed energy resource (DER) adoption including minigrids to expand access and save costs for stakeholders, and 3) demand-side interventions to drive efficient use of energy that enables local economic development. We act through a “think-do-scale” approach, including: (think) developing transformative business models and influential thought leadership detailing market opportunities; (do) creating partnerships to develop innovative demonstration projects; and (scale) translating results to formalize utility, investor, and development programs.
Currently, the Africa Energy Program works alongside country partners in Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Malawi, with regional scaling activities that include partners across many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Since its inception in 2015, the program has also supported partners in Rwanda, Uganda, and Sierra Leone.
Position Overview
We are seeking a highly-motivated Associate or Senior Associate to join RMI’s Africa Energy Program and help drive cutting-edge solutions to support Africa’s energy transition. As an ideal candidate, you are a creative problem solver who uses your experience, quantitative, and qualitative analytical abilities to conduct compelling research and derive new insights around pressing energy issues. You are collaborative and humble in engaging with local partners to understand market needs and conditions. You don’t settle for the status quo—you actively dig deeper to understand the underlying root of problems and focus on generating new ideas and solutions to those barriers. You have experience working with renewable energy systems, deploying appropriate technologies while working with communities in emerging economies, or both.
As an RMI Associate or Senior Associate, you will collaborate with team members, partner organizations, clients, and stakeholders to craft innovative and practical solutions across the Program’s focus areas and geographies.
